Overview
--------

Dependently typed programming languages
-------------------------------------
- Trellys project collaboration, zombie-trellys 
implementation
- combining proofs and programs [POPL 14, MFPS 12]
- elaboration [draft]
- equality and erasure in dependently-typed 
  languages [MFPS 12, POPL 10]

- OPLSS lectures
- keynote talks at RTA, MFPS
- supported by NSF grant

Advanced type systems for Haskell
---------------------------------

Multiple extensions to the GHC type system to better support
"dependently-typed" programming in Haskell. These extensions include GADTs
[ICFP 06], datatype promotion [TLDI 12], roles [POPL 10, ICFP 14], closed-type
families [POPL 14], and kind equalities [ICFP 13].

First-class polymorphism [JFP 06, ICFP 06, ICFP 08]

- supported by NSF grants 
- keynote talks at ICFP and FLOPS
- Collaboration with Simon Peyton Jones, Dimitrios Vytiniotis, and many others

Machine-checked Metatheory 
-------------------------- 

Designing and proving properties about programming languages is hard, but the
proofs themselves are straightforward once you know how to set them up. At the
same time, it is all too easy to miss the one little case that ruins the whole
"proof".

- POPLmark challenge [TPHols]
- Locally nameless representation [POPL 08]
- LNgen tool
- 

talks at LFMTP and Cambridge
supported by NSF grant

Generic programming & data structures 
-------------------------------- 

Defining functions via type information cuts down on boilerplate programming
as many operations may be defined once, for all types of data.

- dissertation work
- generic programming in Agda (spring school lectures)
- replib library
- unbound library
- combinatorial species
- participation in WGP community
