<p>Interested in Graduate Studies at Penn?</p>
<p>That's great! We are  looking for intelligent, motivated and dynamic
  students. See the following <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/grad/applications.shtml">web
  page</a> for information on how to apply. I regret
  that I
  cannot
  answer email
  sent
  directly
  to me asking
  about
  graduate
  studies. If you a considering graduate study of programming languages, besides
  taking courses on programming languages,
  I also encourage you to learn as much as you can about logic, mathematics and
  computation.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>
<p>Stephanie Weirich</p>
