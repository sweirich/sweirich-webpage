Teaching Statement
==================

% Integration of research and teaching, sucessfully brought
  research interests in functional programming into all of my classes.

% Emphasis on Foundations---subsume specific technologies
  - OCaml FP brings foundational approach
  
% Emphasis on learning through experiences. Goal is to craft student experiences
  throughout the course that lead to insight. 
  Students don't really know a topic unless they "do" it themselves
  But, there is a lot that goes into a course to make sure that 
  students can "do" it. 

% Careful attention to diversity in introductory course (esp with respect to
  background)
  - OCaml levels playing field
  - TA selection & diversity discussions during TA training, 
  also conscious that I am a role model

Overview
--------

During my tenure at Penn, I have taught two required introductory courses, one
at the undergraduate (CIS/CSE 120) and one at the graduate level (CIS 500). I
have also taught two elective courses, again, one at the undergraduate (CIS
341) and one at the graduate level (CIS 500). I have also lead several
different graduate seminar courses on various topics in the field of
programming language research. Although the format of these courses varies, I
approach each of these courses with the same general teaching philosophy.

My lectures are always interactive---even in large classes I ask students to
participate. Student participation allows me to demonstrate how problem
solving actually works: instead of presenting a problem and immediately
showing its solution, I ask students to think about a problem for a little
while, take their suggestions (or make a few of my own), and then explore them
briefly to see if they work or, more importantly, where they fall short. My
emphasis is how to use such "failures" as clues to where the real solution
lies.  

Recently, I have incorporated the usage of "clickers" into my lecture courses.

Although the feedback that students receive depends on the course
style, I make sure that it comes promptly, when it is the most
effective. That way, students can better gauge their progress in the
class and determine as soon as possible whether there are topics that
give them trouble. In lecture courses, I give weekly homework
exercises and return graded homeworks as soon as possible.  In seminar
courses, I assign open-ended projects so that students may study
problems tailored to their interests. However, I require weekly
meetings on their progress so that I can provide feedback.

Finally, I provide accessibility through both traditional and electronic
means.  Besides standard office hours, I schedule evening review sessions
before exams, encouraging attendance with pizza.  Students may also contact my
course staff and me via email, course mailing lists and course bulletin
boards. Course material (lecture slides, lecture screencasts, homework,
practice exams) is made available from the course website.


- Overall, I believe that engineers learn best through experience. 

- At the same time, I ensure that the fundamental concepts are not lost in the
details.

Introductory Computer Science, CIS 120
--------------------------------------

- Foundational approach, based on a rigorous model of computation
- Broad overview of fundamental concepts
- Intuitive explanation of concepts
- Practical level-appropriate skills for software development 
  (design process, interactive demos, test-driven development, 
  modern tools such as Eclipse, style grading)

- Experience-based learning
 
- Incorporation of peer learning through TA program and Piazza course discussion group. (CIS 120 is one of the largest users of Piazza at Penn, typically generating over XXX messages each semester.)

- Course materials developed in collaboration with Steve Zdancewic and
Benjamin Pierce including textbook, homework assignments and submission
system. Active developer and maintainer of all of the above---react to
feedback and make sure that the assignments are effective 
(cover the right ideas in a realistic and interesting way at the right level of difficulty). Small details in the assignment specification make a huge difference.

Advanced Programming, CIS 552
-----------------------------
- Interactive code development, "small" class that works together
- Integration of research and teaching 
- Mind-bending topics: goal is to change overall 
- Pair programming, small devilishly difficult 
- Focus on code style and refactoring, in class code analysis
