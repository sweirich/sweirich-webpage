&nbsp; We explore an axiomatized nominal approach to variable binding
in Coq, using an untyped lambda-calculus as our test case.&nbsp; In our
nominal&nbsp; approach, alpha-equality of lambda terms coincides with
Coq's
built-in equality.&nbsp; Our axiomatization includes a nominal
induction
principle and functions for calculating free variables and
substitution.&nbsp;
These axioms are collected in a module signature and proved sound using
locally nameless terms as the underlying representation.&nbsp; Our
experience so far suggests that it is
feasible to work from such axiomatized theories in Coq and that the
nominal
style of variable binding corresponds closely with paper proofs.&nbsp;
We
are currently working on proving the soundness of a primitive recursion
combinator and developing a method of generating these axioms and their
proof of soundness from a grammar describing the syntax of terms and
binding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

between the code and the description in the paper.<br>
