Change log for LNgen
====================


Version 0.3
-----------

* LNgen generates  local closure predicates  for both `Prop`  and `Set`.
  Theorems are stated using the version in `Prop`.

* The distribution includes the Coq formalizations for the paper "LNgen:
  Tool Support for Locally Nameless Representations."


Version 0.2
-----------

* Output from LNgen integrates more nicely with the output from Ott.  In
  fact, the output from LNgen must  be combined with the output from Ott
  in order  for everything to compile.   For this all  to work, however,
  you must patch Ott and structure your input files in a particular way.
  Details are in the README file that comes with the distribution.

* Output  from LNgen requires  "the regular"  metatheory library,  not a
  customized version  that departs  radically from previous  releases of
  the library.

* LNgen accepts  additional command-line arguments---in  particular, one
  to admit  all generated lemmas (useful during  language development to
  avoid repeated recompilation).

* LNgen,  in concert with  Ott, generates  local closure  predicates for
  `Set`  and `Prop`.   The two  version  are proved  equivalent to  each
  other.  Most lemmas are proved for the version in Prop.

* LNgen generates statements and proofs of more lemmas.


Version 0.1
-----------

* Initial release.
