<h4>Bedrock: Mechanized Programming Language Metatheory</h4>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recently organized the Mechanizing Metatheory
Workshop at ICFP 2006. I am currently teaching a graduate level seminar
course about this topic. This project is supported by NSF ....<br>
<h4>Type-directed programming </h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am fascinated by programs that compute with type
information. This is a form of reflection---instead of programming with
data we are programming with metadata. My interest in this area has
been incorporated in the design a Haskell library, a version of Java
that supports Type-directed programming, and also spurs my interest in
AspectML.&nbsp; Older work in this area includes ... and my
dissertation.<br>
<h4>Type inference for advanced type systems</h4>
